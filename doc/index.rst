INDRA documentation
===================

INDRA (Integrated Network and Dynamical Reasoning Assembler) assembles
information about biochemical mechanisms into a common format that can be used
to build several different kinds of explanatory models.  Sources of mechanistic
information include databases (such as Pathway Commons and Biological
Expression Language (BEL) corpora), natural language and text from the
literature. Mechanistic information from multiple sources is de-duplicated,
standardized and assembled into sets mechanistic ``Statements`` with associated
evidence.  Sets of ``Statements`` can then be used to assemble executable
rule-based models and a variety of different network models.
