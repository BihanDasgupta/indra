statements_schema.json contains a JSON schema (http://json-schema.org) for a
list of INDRA statements serialized in JSON format.

This schema can be used to validate whether a JSON file filled with INDRA
statements is in the proper form. Some validation tools include:

* ajv-cli (https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv-cli): Install with
    "npm install -g ajv-cli" and then validate with:
    ajv -s statements_schema.json -d file_to_validate.json
* There are a variety of web-based tools for validation with JSON schemas,
  including https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net
