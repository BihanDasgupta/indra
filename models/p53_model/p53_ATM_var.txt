ATM phosphorylates ATM, and phosphorylated ATM is activated.
ATM activates p53.
p53 is transcribed and active p53 transcribes MDM2.
MDM2 is degraded.
p53 activates Wip1.
Wip1 inactivates p53.
Wip1 dephosphorylates ATM.
MDM2 ubiquitinates p53 and ubiquitinated p53 is degraded.
HIPK2 inactivates Wip1.
