ATM phosphorylates itself and phosphorylated ATM is activated.
Phosphorylated ATM activates p53.
p53 is transcribed and p53 transcribes MDM2.
MDM2 is degraded.
p53 activates Wip1.
Wip1 inactivates p53.
Wip1 inactivates ATM.
MDM2 ubiquitinates p53 and ubiquitinated p53 is degraded.
Protease inactivates Wip1.
P14ARF inactivates Mdm2.
